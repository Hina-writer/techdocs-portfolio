# 🖋️Welcome to my documentation portfolio

I'm a Senior Technical Writer and documentation specialist with 7+ years of experience simplifying complexity across engineering, product, and creative teams. I thrive on clarity, collaboration, and purpose-driven documentation. I’ve also worked as an Editor, giving me strong insights into creative writing, editing, and editorial review.

## 🏡Documentation Homepage

This space showcases a selection of documentation samples I’ve created or am fully equipped to deliver as a technical writer. Each piece reflects my ability to translate complex ideas into clear, user-friendly content, whether through structured guides, API references, or editorial layouts. I use tools like Git, VS Code, and Markdown in Docs-as-Code workflows, and I approach every project with a focus on clarity, consistency, and user impact.
