# Technical Documentation Portfolio

This portfolio showcases my practical experience with Docs-as-Code workflows, structured authoring, and editorial storytelling. It reflects how I plan, write, and deliver clear, scalable documentation for technical and regulated products.

Built with [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and the Material theme, the site demonstrates how raw Markdown, version control, and lightweight tooling can produce professional, review-friendly documentation without a complex publishing pipeline.

## 📁 Included Samples

- **Style Guide** (`style-guide.md`)  
  Editorial standards for consistent, accessible, and user-centered documentation.

- **Scene Editor Guide** (`scene-editor.md`)  
  A visual, step-by-step guide to help users navigate a game scene editor interface.

- **API Reference** (`api-reference.md`)  
  A sample Weather API doc showcasing clear endpoint descriptions and example responses.

- **BAMBI Magazine** (`bambi.md`)  
  Editorial layout samples from a print magazine, highlighting visual storytelling and design.

All content is written in Markdown and organized in the `docs/` folder. Assets are stored in `docs/assets/images/`.

## 🎯 Purpose

Created independently to demonstrate:
- Structured, scalable authoring practices
- Proficiency with Git, Markdown, and Docs-as-Code workflows
- A thoughtful, user-focused approach to documentation planning and delivery
- The ability to blend technical clarity with editorial polish

This portfolio is designed to be concise, navigable, and ready to discuss in interviews or collaborative reviews.
