# TechDocs Portfolio

This portfolio highlights my practical work with Docs-as-Code workflows in GitLab. It reflects how I plan, structure, and deliver clear documentation for complex and regulated products.

## Included Documentation Samples

- **StyleGuide.md** – Editorial standards for consistent, user-focused documentation
- **GettingStarted.md** – A setup guide based on a game scene editor.
- **API-Reference.md** – A sample API doc to demonstrate technical adaptability and interface documentation.

All files are written in raw Markdown and organized in the `docs/` folder. GitLab’s native rendering allows for lightweight, reviewable documentation without a publishing pipeline.

## Purpose

Created independently to showcase:
- Structured, scalable authoring practices
- Proficiency with GitLab and Docs-as-Code workflows
- A thoughtful approach to documentation planning and delivery

Designed to be concise, review-friendly, and ready to discuss in interviews.
